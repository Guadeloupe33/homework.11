## Project Overview

This project is a simple note-taking application designed to meet the needs of small business owners. It provides a user-friendly interface for writing and saving notes, enabling users to organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks effectively.

## User Story

As a small business owner, I want to be able to write and save notes so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Landing Page

When you open the Note Taker, you will be presented with a landing page that features a link to access the notes page.

### Notes Page

Clicking on the link to the notes page will take you to a page with a two-column layout.
The left-hand column displays a list of existing notes.
The right-hand column provides empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text.

### Creating and Saving Notes

When you enter a new note title and the note's text, two buttons will appear in the navigation at the top of the page:
- "Save Note" - To save the newly entered note.
- "Clear Form" - To clear the fields and start over.

Clicking on the "Save Note" button will save the new note, and it will appear in the left-hand column alongside existing notes. The navigation buttons will disappear upon saving.

### Viewing and Editing Notes

To view an existing note, click on the note's title in the left-hand column.
The selected note will then be displayed in the right-hand column.
A "New Note" button will appear in the navigation at the top of the page.

### Creating a New Note

Clicking on the "New Note" button in the navigation will clear the existing fields.
You will be presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and note text in the right-hand column.
The "New Note" button will disappear, allowing you to start creating a new note.
